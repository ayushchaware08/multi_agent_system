# Key API Routes:
# /ask accepts a query and any PDF doc_id, routes to Controller.decide(), which selects an agent and returns {"answer": answer, "agent": agent, "trace": ...}.
# /upload_pdf accepts file, checks size, stores it, and performs inline PDF-to-Chroma ingestion (returns ingestion status).
# /logs returns decision logs for debugging.
# /ask accepts either query text or reference to uploaded PDF id â€” controller decides which agent to call and logs full reasoning + retrieved doc ids and timestamps.
# /logs returns recent decision logs (with filtering capability).
